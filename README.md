Scrap ‘n’ Craft is an innovative app offers users insights into the various ways they can recycle their used items and leftover food. It also allows users to share their waste-recycling creations/strategies. By applying machine learning technology, users can take pictures of used items they have and the application will provide a list of creations that can be made from these items.
